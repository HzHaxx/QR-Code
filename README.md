## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox 
- Desktop-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - For CSS
- [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) 

### What I learned

I learned how to use the `gulp` task runner to compile `sass` files to `css` files and optimize images. I also learned how to use `gulp` to watch for changes in the `sass` files and automatically compile them to `css` files. 

### Continued development

I'd like in the future use grid to make the layout more responsive and to make the code more clean and organized. 
I will also implement js to my projects to make them more interactive and dynamic.
